					As Isaac Asmimov once said, "Science can amuse and fascinate us all, but it is engineering that changes the world."
					Ever since I was a child, I have been enamored with stories of how the technology has brought forth a massive revolution in the world around us. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Engineers have always been at the forefront of making conventionally implausible things a reality whether it be through exploring the frontier 
					of space or the ability to transmit data via internet. It is that desire to make a change that drives me through the
					brighest of days and the darkest of hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having been bitten by the sustainability bug early on, I spent my high school volunteering at a Dubai based NGO called ‘Green Hope UAE’ 
					who organized clean-up and recycling campaigns in collaboration with the UN.

					Over the course of my time at A&M, I have been involved with the Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) where my group designed a 
					sustainability demo showcasing energy consumption discrepencies. Also being an two-term officer 
					at IEEE-TAMU, we organized volunteering & scholarship opportunities for members. 
				</p>
				
				<p>This semester I intend to get more involved with organizations like the 12th Can to reinforce my committment to 
					service as a lifestyle. A life spent not in service of others is a life wasted in my opinion.
